# Fraud Detection Using 3 Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. The implementation is done in Google Colab, leveraging various techniques for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature engineering, data scaling, time-based feature extraction, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and AdaBoost for classification.
- **Environment:** Google Colab for implementation and experimentation.
